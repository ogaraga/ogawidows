         <h2>Vital information</h2>
      <p>
        Crisis control or management is defined as the process by which an
        organization deals with unexpected events that threaten to harm the
        organization or its stakeholders. Ogaranya widows empowerment is a member
        of crisis managment lagos branch where it ensures that the lives and concerns of
        Badagry widows are not threatened in any way. It is the responsibility of ogaranyawilorg crisis control department to ensure the safety of lives and property of the organisation. Reasons for failure to deliver ones duty or task is not welcome here. We are strict in this aspect because we understand the economic importance of crisis and why they must be prevented or speedily tackled if they occurred.
        Crises can negatively affect the reputation of an organisation,
        employees and clients. Organisational crisis might happen due to
        internal or external factors. Depending on the severity it is vital to
        have a Crisis Control department in order to fix any crisis related
        event. From inception till date, we have not recorded any crisis amongst the staff and the widows in badagry through effective monitoring and pre-crisis control mechanism. We must maintain our strife to becoming the number one NGO in Africa be ensuring working mechanism are put in place at all times.

        <h2>Crisis Management process.</h2>
        <p>
          The control or management of crisis means much more than the problem
          itself, hence this department. We do not wait for crisis to happen before acting. We act before it happens.
        </p>
        <h3>Crisis Phases</h3>
        <p>
          There are about 3 phases to crisis control namely:
          <span
            ><b>pre-crisis</b>:The first step in resolving a crisis is preventing it from happening. This involves creating a department for this kind of situation and
            hiring and training volunteers/staff to develop and implement a crisis plan. That is what we do here. Also, it is essential to have a clear communication for everyone to inform them about the
            situation and not creating a panic situation. Pre-written crisis
            messages, information or jingles helps get our team prepared ahead thereby saving time resolving any crisis event when it occurrs.
          </span>
          <span
            ><b>Crisis management & response</b>:The second step of the process is to directly handle and manage the problem. This stage is
            when we implement developed plans. Crisis messages
            are released, and employees are in contact and always updated on the
            situation.Our crisis team must resolve the problem before
            the damage increases.
          </span>
          <span
            ><b>Post-crisis</b>: When we pass through the crisis successfully. It is imperative
            to remain in contact with your employees, clients, etc. to announce that the storm is over and that everything is normal. After the crisis has been
            resolved, we try to answer questions from everyone interested in our projects. Finally, we endeavour to conclude with our crisis team on the response rate and areas that need immediate modifications for better performance in subsequence happenings.
          </span>

        <h2>Types of crises</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Financial crisis</b>: Experiencing decline in winning overseas or local partnership/grants can affect financial box of the organization. Also, inefficient and ineffective handling/execution of projects could lead to decline in getting contracts, hence financial down-times. We strive to be professional and technical in implementing all won contracts. We have zero tolerance to fraud and stealing. All financial report must be done very accountably and professionally well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>          Personnel crisis</b>: This occurs when employees or someone associated
          with the organisation is involved in an action that is considered
          unethical, illegal, or harmful for the business.We have had this issue in the past, but a lot of changes have taken place where this department ensures tenecious accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Organizational crisis</b>: This happens when a brand is engaging
          wrongfully with the customers by taking actions that impact clients
          negatively. An example of this situation is represented by keeping
          away important information from clients when they deserve to know
          what they are investing in. We have a clean sheet here.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Technological crisis</b>: We are just getting our website on the net. We have not had any server issues or data related compromise even though we have technicl team that sees to the security of our server and database. 
        </p>
        <p>
